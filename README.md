# Pirsch Go Proxy

A self-hosted proxy for the Pirsch Analytics JavaScript snippet.

## Why should I use a proxy?

The benefit of using a proxy is that your website will only make first-party requests. The JavaScript snippets are hosted on your own server. Requests to pirsch.io will be proxied through your server, preventing them from being blocked by ad blockers.

Additionally, you can create rollup views and send data to multiple dashboards with a single request on the client.
